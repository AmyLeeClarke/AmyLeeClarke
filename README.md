<div align="left"><p top="100">I am a Policing and Criminal Investigation graduate with a passion for coding, after I had completed University with a 2:1, I decided where I would like my career path to go. I absolutely strive on learning so I started coding using accessible courses and learning materials on sites such as Udemy. During this time, I have learned many data analytic aspects of the Python coding language alongside data management software SQL and Excel. I have a diary that I keep, as I code every weekday, this is to hold myself accountable and keep track of all aspects of my learning. This GitHub account is also to track my learning and inspire me to keep coding and learn as much as possible by seeing other peoples progressions.

I take pride in making my data look presentable so I can look back and easily read the data. This includes data visualization using the Matplotlib package and Tableau. I greatly enjoy spending time making dashboards look interesting and to tell a story, my presentation skills from University allows me to communicate these findings to others.

On a personal level, I am a very creative person who is always coming up with fun and spontaneous decisions and ideas. I have always had a love for craft and I see coding as a form of art, to be able to create something from nothing is absolutely fascinating to me. Due to my past careers being on the shop floor I have amazing communication skills along with presentation skills from University which makes me thrive in a motivated team of people as well as working great independently.
